# Repo_machine_learning

This repository collects existing machine learning and deep learning tutorials based on their implementation frameworks. 
For deep learning, the repository collects three widely used frameworks:
- Keras (now a API in Tensorflow)
- Tensorflow 1.x/2.x
- Pytorch
Also, the repository collects (unofficial) APIs in Julia.
