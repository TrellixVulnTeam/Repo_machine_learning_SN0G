# Repo_machine_learning

This repository collects existing machine learning and deep learning tutorials based on their implementation frameworks. 

For basic machine learning, the repository collects models using both ``Sklearn`` 
and low-level ``Numpy`` implementation.

For deep learning, the repository collects three widely used frameworks:
- Keras (now an API in Tensorflow)
- Tensorflow 1.x/2.x
- Pytorch

In addition, the repository collects some useful repositories that help better 
  understanding and usage of deep learning frameworks:
- Low-level Numpy implementation
- (unofficial) deep learning APIs in Julia.
- Some deep learning usecases
